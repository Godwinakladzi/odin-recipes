            <p>What is a Banana Daiquiri?
            A banana daiquiri is a cocktail of pureed, ripe bananas, <br>lime juice and rum. It’s basically a spiked banana smoothie.
            </p>
            
            <p>Daiquiris must contain rum (the age of the rum can be left to your discretion) and a complimentary citrus juice.<br> Bananas, when blended, create a thick and viscous concoction which is why it’s best served as a frozen drink, but if you can find a decent banana nectar, you can prepare it the old-fashioned way—shaken.

            <p>Ripe Bananas and Fresh Lime are a Must<br>
            The level of ripeness of the banana will determine how much banana flavor comes through in the finished drink. <br>I prefer my cocktail to have a heavy dose of banana flavor, so a banana with a dark yellow, heavily-mottled with brown skin is a must. I’d even go so far as to suggest using a banana with a black peel for maximum banana flavor.
            </p>
            <p>The lime juice in this recipe breaks through the caramel notes of the banana and dark rum to mitigate the cloyingly sweet properties overripe bananas.<br> Basically, it balances the sweetness of the banana and brown sugar.</article>
